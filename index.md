# Professional Self-Assessment

#### I have always been fascinated by how something works. My journey with computers began a long time ago in an operating system long since forgotten. At a very young age, my father sat me in front of an IBM 8080 and showed me what buttons to press to play Pac-Man. Gobbling power pellets would only be the beginning. There would be other video games, and when presented with a technical issue my loving father would point me in the direction of the DOS manual. There would be video games that would require the development of short and simple scripts in order to win, and at the click of a few keyboard buttons, my love for programming began.

#### Before entering the Computer Science program with SNHU, I have made several scripts that do short and simple tasks. I have also made a few that would borderline on artificial intelligence. Unfortunately, at the time I did not know the terminology or the best practices. My skills were rough, unrefined, and self-taught. The program at SNHU has helped me refine my skills, given names to algorithms I already understood, and have introduced me to best practices. I have always been a team player but now would consider myself a star player. I understand the intricacies of data structures and algorithms, the complexity of software engineering and databases, and the importance of security. Fortunately for me, I also wield more than 20 years of experience with AT&T as a central office technician that has helped me along the way.

#### Below are three artifacts that I have been working on in the Computer Science program with SNHU. The first one is from CS 410 Reverse Software engineering final project. It was originally a piece of compiled legacy code that was rewritten into C and then rewritten again into Python. I did not stop there. I gave it better security, better user interface, and functionality. The second and third artifacts are both from the same project from CS 340 Advanced Programming Concepts. Originally parts of this code did not function as intended. I repaired what did not work, gave this program the ability to save data, and gave it the ability to do more robust searches within the database. My greatest weakness is the lack of experience in modern programming languages. I have a huge opportunity for growth in C, C++, JAVA, and C# that I plan to take advantage of over the next year.

# Artifact 1 student utility

##  This program that allows the user to edit student names and or grades.

### The student information is held within students.csv
### The user loging and password information is held within users.csv

#### Currently the only two users are:
####    "Gregg": 123
####    "Rusty": 456


           The first artifact is from my final project in CS 410: Reverse Software engineering.  I wrote this program in June of 2020, and it was
reversed engineered from a compiled legacy executable.  The program allows a user to login and makes change student grades.  The program is riddled
with design flaws, but it works exactly like the legacy program it was reversed engineered from.

           I chose this artifact because it is riddled with problems. When I first wrote this program, I had a list of things that I wanted to change,
but could not because that is not what the assignment required.  The original assignment asked to write the legacy program in C, and that is what I did.
I made several artifact improvements. One of the things that I wanted to showcase was my attention to detail.  I rewrote the program in Python, and
addressed some of the items from my “list of things I wanted to change.” It bothered me that the names and the grades did not align.  I fixed that.  I
also did not like how I was forced to edit every student on the list to make a change.  I added a menu to allow the user to edit one student at a time. 
The student’s name or grade can be changed.  The changes are then saved to a file.  The file will be reloaded on program restart.  

I feel that I have met the course objectives.  I feel that I went above the objectives with all the enhancements that I made.  One of the suggestions was to Transfer a project into a different language.  I feel that I did that when I rewrote the program in Python.    I also added a user database with hashed passwords, added the ability for the user to edit one student at a time, and gave more functionality to the menu system. 

I enjoy writing code. I find that the C languages are a bit of a challenge for me.  I enjoy writing in Python because of its flow.  I want to become more efficient with C and C++. I know the only way to get better at programming is to program.   I did learn how to write to a file.  I do not recall if I did that in my Python class or not, but I imagine that I will be referencing documentation that I have a

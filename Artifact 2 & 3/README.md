# Artifacts 2 & 3: Advanced Programming Concepts: Narratives

##### The second and third artifact is from my final project in the CS 340 Advanced Programming Concepts. I wrote this program in June of 2020. It involves two programs. One is server.py, and it is a program that connects to a Mongo database that is running locally and accepting connections on port 27017. The Mongo database needs to have the JSON file Stocks imported. The JSON file is a collection of company information such as stock price, ticker symbol, and Return on Equity.  The client.py program to perform get requests on the Mongo database through the server.py program.  

##### For the algorithms and data structure, I selected this project because there are several programs running to make everything work. There are a bunch of moving parts here, and I believe that this showcases my ability to keep track of multiple items. I added the ability for the user to download all company information and save it to a file as well as display it to the screen. When the user is given the option to save the information to a file, the program will only take a “y” or “n” in either upper or lower case as an answer. I learned how to create loops that do not allow the user to escape them until it receives the correct input.  The program will add the extension of “.txt” if the user did not enter it.  According to (Deepa, et al., 2018) “improper user input is one of the fundamental security concerns in any web application.”

##### I felt like I met the requirements of algorithms and data structure because this version allows the user to save information whereas the previous version did not, and it will not allow the user to enter invalid data. I learned a significant amount while creating this project.  Originally, I was forced to develop this in Python 2.7. I had an issue where the program would crash while trying to get user input. Apparently, there is an issue with the input function within Python version 2, and after researching the fix I found using raw input over the input function would correct this problem. However, in Python version 3 raw input function was renamed to input.  I changed my original code to accommodate this update.

##### For the database artifact, I added the ability for the user to query the server looking for stocks that fall within a defined range and sorted the top 10 stocks based on “Return on Investment” in descending order. I learned how to get the data from the server, transmit it to the client, and have the client store the information in an array. My goal was to only return the names of the companies that fit these criteria and not the entire JSON entry for the stock.

##### Originally there was a section of this code that did not work. I was not able to poll specific details about a stock that I was interested in, but I was able to discover my problem and correct the code. I cleaned up a significant amount of the menus, consolidated some other menus, and made this thing easier to read. I was able to consolidate two menus together. I corrected an issue that would allow the user to enter a stock ticker that was not capitalized. I also added the ability for the user to advance up or down a list of stock “details”. 
          
##### I believe that I met the objectives. I have already spent a significant amount of time getting items that did not originally work. I had a hard time getting the details section to work on the server. I learned a good bit about manipulating JSON files into strings and arrays. I had a difficult time getting the data to display back to the client the way I wanted, but in the end, everything works.
